# DeepExpr: Facial Expression and Pose Generation via Self-Supervised Disentangled Embeddings Fusion in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models

---

## üìú Abstract

Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential in personalized image synthesis. However, they fall short in providing a dedicated framework for human-centric tasks. Specifically, while they can successfully render a person in new textual contexts or backgrounds, they lack precise control over critical human attributes such as facial expression and head pose.

Recent efforts have attempted to bridge this gap by injecting externally learned embeddings into pre-trained text-to-image models. However, these approaches often fall short in ensuring accurate expression control and pose alignment, primarily due to the limited semantic capacity of the external embeddings. Furthermore, the direct injection of these embeddings tends to degrade facial fidelity and compromise identity preservation.

To overcome these limitations, we propose **DeepExpr**, a framework that enables precise control over facial expression and head pose while preserving identity across diverse visual contexts. DeepExpr comprises two key components:

1. **Semantic and Identity Disentanglement (SID)** ‚Äî A self-supervised module leveraging frame-to-frame supervision to disentangle identity and expression representations.
2. **Multi-Embedding Fusion (MEF)** ‚Äî A mechanism to integrate these embeddings into pre-trained diffusion models without degrading fidelity.
